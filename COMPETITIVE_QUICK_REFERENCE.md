## SECTION 2: QUICK WIN/LOSS MATRIX

| Scenario | Win Rate | Effort | Notes |
|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| Mid-market (100-250 vehicles) greenfield | 45-50% | Medium | Our sweet spot |
| Samsara customer w/ support complaints | 35-45% | High | Target pain |

---

## SECTION 3: COMPETITIVE OBJECTION RESPONSES

### "Samsara is the market leader"
**Response:** "Innovation leader, yes. Market leader in brand. But paying premium for brand costs you $10k+/month vs us. Market share ≠ better product."

**Proof:** Show Samsara customer complaint quotes about support. Show TCO comparison. Show customer testimonials about our support.

---

### "We're locked in Samsara 3-year contract"
**Response:** "That's the situation many of our customers are in. We're here for your renewal. Let's talk about what you want differently in 12-18 months."

**Action:** Schedule contract renewal discussion, send comparison for future. Don't waste sales cycles on captive customer.

---

### "Geotab has 430 integrations, you only have 50"
**Response:** "True. Most customers use 10-15 of those integrations actively. We cover the 10-15 that matter. The other 400 are nice-to-have. We're also adding integrations; what's your #1 must-have integration?"

**Proof:** Feature/integration usage audit for similar customer. Show that 90%+ of Geotab customers use <20 of the 430.

---

### "Your company is too new"
**Response:** "Fair question. Our team has [X years] combined experience. We're funded by [investors]. And frankly, new means better technology and support. Geotab's platform is 15 years old."

**Proof:** Team bios, investor backing, product demo showing modern tech. Customer satisfaction metrics proving support quality.

---

### "Motive is cheaper"
**Response:** "For small fleets, yes. At your scale (150+ vehicles), you need enterprise features Motive doesn't offer. You've outgrown Motive. We're the natural next step."

**Proof:** Feature comparison chart showing advanced reporting, maintenance management, EV features. Customer story of company that grew out of Motive.

---

### "Verizon's network integration is important"
**Response:** "Understood. We integrate with Verizon services. You get the best of both: their network + our better interface/pricing."

**Proof:** Integration documentation. Demo showing Verizon API connection.

---

### "We need the best ELD"
**Response:** "Both we and Motive are excellent ELDs. Motive is slightly better for drivers; we're equivalent. ELD is now table-stakes, not differentiator. Focus on what else matters: support, analytics, price."

**Proof:** ELDRatings scores showing we're equivalent. Both FMCSA certified.

---

### "Implementation might delay our go-live"
**Response:** "That's the risk with most vendors (Samsara = 90+ days, Geotab = 120+ days). We guarantee 6-week implementation or you don't pay. It's in our SLA."

**Proof:** Implementation SLA document. Customer case studies showing 6-week go-live.

---

### "Your support might not be as good"
**Response:** "Support is exactly where other customers have problems with Samsara and Geotab. We guarantee 24-hour response and 95% resolution <5 days. That's in our SLA."

**Proof:** Support SLA document. Customer testimonials comparing to competitors.

## SECTION 5: ELEVATOR PITCHES (By Scenario)

### For Mid-Market Prospect
"We're Fleet [Name]. We provide enterprise-grade fleet management for companies with 50-250 vehicles - think of us as getting Samsara's features at transparent pricing, with support that actually responds. Our customers save 25-30% vs Samsara while getting deployed in 6 weeks instead of 3 months. Can I show you how?"

### For Samsara Refugee
"We specialize in helping companies transition from Samsara. Our key differences: transparent pricing (no 'call for quote'), responsive support (24 hours vs 2 months), and flexible contracts (month-to-month available). Many of our customers came from Samsara and say the difference is night-and-day."

### For Geotab Customer
"We're the modern alternative to Geotab. Same integration capability, modern interface, better support, faster implementation. If you love Geotab's ecosystem but wish the platform was built in 2025 instead of 2010, you should talk to us."

### For Growing Motive Customer
"You've done great with Motive. You've also grown to 150+ vehicles, and Motive's SMB focus is limiting what you can do. We're the natural next step: keep the simplicity, add enterprise analytics and advanced features you need."

### For Verizon Customer
"We do what Verizon does (with slightly better interface), but with transparent pricing and flexible contracts. No more 'contact us for pricing' - you see exactly what you pay. And month-to-month is available if you want flexibility."
