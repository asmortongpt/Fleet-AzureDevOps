# FLEET: ONE-PAGE SALES SUMMARY
## The Modern Operating System for Fleet Management

---

## PROBLEM: FLEET OPERATORS ARE STUCK IN 2010

- **Legacy Software:** Old interfaces, slow innovation, poor mobile experience
- **Integration Nightmares:** GPS here, maintenance there, fuel somewhere else
- **Poor ROI:** Can't see where savings are coming from

**Result:** Fleets are leaving $50K-$100K on the table annually due to inefficiency

## THE NUMBERS: WHAT FLEET SAVES YOU

### For a 100-Vehicle Fleet (Year 1)

| Area | Savings | Timeframe |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Fuel Costs** | $24K-$36K | Immediate (12-18% reduction) |
| **Maintenance** | $15K-$22K | Q1 (predictive maintenance) |
| **Driver Overtime** | $4K-$6K | Q1 (route optimization) |
| **Insurance Claims** | $8K-$14K | Ongoing (safety improvements) |
| **Admin Labor** | $3K-$5K | Q1 (automation) |

| | | |
| **TOTAL ANNUAL SAVINGS** | **$69K-$108K** | Most in Year 1 |
| **Fleet Platform Cost** | **$36-60K** | ($30-50 per vehicle) |
| | | |
| **NET SAVINGS (Year 1)** | **$33K-$72K** | 47-200% ROI |

## KEY DIFFERENTIATORS: WHY FLEET IS DIFFERENT

### 1. **Mobile-First Design**
Your drivers live on their phones. Fleet is built for mobile from day one (not a web app squeezed into mobile). 500+ beta testers give us 4.2/5.0 rating.

### 2. **Open Integrations**
We don't force you into our ecosystem. Integrate with your fuel card, accounting software, HR system. Your tech stack stays intact.

### 3. **AI That Shows ROI**
Predictive maintenance shows **$15K-$45K annual savings** per fleet. Most software shows dashboards. Fleet shows dollars.

### 4. **White-label for Partners**
Reselling? We white-label. Your brand, our platform. 40% margin for you, 60% for us. Win-win.

### 5. **Pricing Built for Mid-Market**
Samsara charges $40-70/vehicle. Fleet is $30-45/vehicle for the same features. When you have 200 vehicles, that's $12K-$24K annual savings right there.

### 6. **Implementation in Weeks**
Average setup is 2-3 weeks (vs. 6-8 weeks for competitors). Your drivers start using it immediately with zero learning curve.

## THE ROI CALCULATOR: PLUG IN YOUR NUMBERS

**Use this simple formula:**

```
ANNUAL SAVINGS = (Vehicle Count × $580) + (Fuel Spend × 15%)

Where $580 = average savings per vehicle per year
      15% = typical fuel savings %

EXAMPLE (100 vehicles, $200K annual fuel spend):
= (100 × $580) + ($200K × 15%)
= $58,000 + $30,000
= $88,000 annual savings

Minus Fleet cost ($54K for 100 vehicles)
= $34,000 net annual savings (or $88,000 gross)
```
