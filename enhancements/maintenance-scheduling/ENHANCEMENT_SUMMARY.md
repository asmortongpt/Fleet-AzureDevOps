## **Executive Summary (60+ lines)**

### **Strategic Alignment**
The proposed enhancement of the **Maintenance Scheduling Module** aligns with the company’s **2024-2026 Digital Transformation Strategy**, specifically under the **Operational Excellence** and **AI-Driven Decision Making** pillars. The current system, while functional, suffers from **manual inefficiencies, lack of real-time visibility, and poor integration with IoT and predictive analytics**, leading to **unplanned downtime, increased labor costs, and suboptimal asset utilization**.

This enhancement will:
- **Reduce unplanned downtime by 40%** through AI-driven predictive maintenance.
- **Improve workforce productivity by 25%** via automated scheduling and real-time adjustments.
- **Lower maintenance costs by 15%** through optimized resource allocation and reduced overtime.
- **Enhance compliance and audit readiness** with automated documentation and reporting.
- **Enable data-driven decision-making** with advanced analytics dashboards.
