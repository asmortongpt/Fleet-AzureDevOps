## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (1-PAGE OVERVIEW)**

### **Strategic Imperative**
The **Billing-Invoicing Module** is a critical revenue operations component of our **Fleet Management System (FMS)**, directly impacting **cash flow, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency**. Current limitations—**manual processes, billing errors, delayed invoicing, and lack of automation**—are eroding **profit margins, customer trust, and scalability**.

This **enhancement initiative** proposes a **comprehensive modernization** of the billing-invoicing module to:
