### **1.1 Business Context and Market Positioning**
The global fleet management market is projected to reach **$52.5 billion by 2027**, growing at a **CAGR of 10.2%** (MarketsandMarkets, 2023). Within this landscape, the **garage-workshop module** of our Fleet Management System (FMS) plays a **critical role in operational efficiency, cost control, and customer satisfaction**. Currently, our system supports **12,500+ fleet operators** across **North America and Europe**, managing **over 1.8 million vehicles annually**.

However, **competitive benchmarking** reveals that **leading FMS providers (e.g., Fleetio, Geotab, Samsara)** have **superior workshop management capabilities**, including:
- **Automated job scheduling** (reducing idle time by **22-30%**)
- **Predictive maintenance integration** (lowering unplanned downtime by **18%**)
- **Real-time technician productivity tracking** (improving labor efficiency by **15%**)
- **AI-driven parts inventory optimization** (reducing stockouts by **40%**)

Our current **garage-workshop module** lags in **automation, integration, and analytics**, leading to:
- **Higher operational costs** (estimated **$12.4M annually** in inefficiencies)
- **Lower customer retention** (churn rate of **8.7%**, vs. industry average of **6.2%**)
- **Reduced competitive differentiation** (only **38% of customers rate our workshop module as "excellent,"** compared to **55% for top competitors**)

This enhancement initiative aims to **modernize the garage-workshop module** to **align with industry best practices**, **improve profitability**, and **enhance customer loyalty**.
