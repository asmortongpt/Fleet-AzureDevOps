- **Higher insurance premiums** (12% annual increase attributed to poor safety metrics)
- **Reputation risk** (22% of clients cite safety concerns as a key factor in contract renewals)

**Proposed Solution:**
A **next-generation SIM module** with **AI-driven predictive analytics, automated compliance reporting, and real-time incident response**, designed to:
✅ **Reduce incident rates by 40%** through proactive risk mitigation
✅ **Cut compliance-related fines by 75%** via automated regulatory reporting
✅ **Lower insurance premiums by 15-20%** through improved safety metrics
✅ **Enhance customer retention by 25%** via transparent safety reporting
