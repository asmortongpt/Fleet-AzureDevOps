| **Lack of Automated Testing** | 30% test coverage (vs. 90% industry standard) | **$400K** (test automation) |
| **Poor Documentation** | No API docs, outdated wiki | **$200K** (documentation overhaul) |
| **No CI/CD Pipeline** | Manual deployments, 2-3 releases/year | **$300K** (DevOps setup) |
| **Hardcoded Business Logic** | Rules embedded in code (e.g., compliance checks) | **$400K** (rules engine) |
| **Total** | | **$2.1M** |

#### **2.2.5 Security Vulnerabilities**
The current system has **critical security gaps**:

| **Vulnerability** | **Risk Level** | **Potential Impact** | **Mitigation Cost** |
|-------------------|----------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **No Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** | High | Unauthorized data access | **$150K** (IAM implementation) |
