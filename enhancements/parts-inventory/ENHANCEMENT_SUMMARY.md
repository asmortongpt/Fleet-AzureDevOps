## **Executive Summary** *(60+ lines)*

### **Strategic Alignment & Business Imperative**
The proposed enhancement of the **Parts-Inventory Module** is a **mission-critical initiative** that aligns with [Company Name]’s **2024-2026 Digital Transformation Strategy**, specifically under the **Operational Excellence** and **Customer-Centric Automation** pillars. The current system, while functional, suffers from **technical debt, inefficiencies, and scalability limitations** that directly impact:

1. **Supply Chain Resilience** – Delays in parts tracking lead to **stockouts (12% of orders annually)**, costing **$2.1M/year in lost sales and expedited shipping fees**.
2. **Operational Efficiency** – Manual data entry and reconciliation consume **4,200+ labor hours/year**, equivalent to **$380K in wasted productivity**.
3. **Customer Satisfaction** – **37% of customer complaints** stem from inventory inaccuracies, contributing to a **14% churn rate** among high-value clients.
4. **Regulatory Compliance** – The current system lacks **audit trails and real-time reporting**, exposing the company to **$150K/year in compliance penalties** (e.g., ISO 9001, ITAR, GDPR).

This enhancement will **eliminate these inefficiencies** by introducing:
✅ **AI-driven demand forecasting** (reducing stockouts by **40%**)
✅ **Real-time inventory tracking** (cutting reconciliation time by **75%**)
✅ **Automated reordering & supplier integration** (reducing lead times by **30%**)
