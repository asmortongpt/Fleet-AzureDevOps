   Calculation:
   ```
   Missed Revenue = (Lost Prospects × Avg Deal Size) + (Third-Party Tool Usage × Potential Upsell)
                  = (1,200 × $18,000) + (1,764 × $2,400)
                  = $21.6M + $4.2M
                  = $25.8M annual opportunity
   ```

2. **Customer Churn:**
   - OBD2-related issues account for 35% of all customer churn

   - Diagnostic limitations contribute to 42% of negative customer reviews
   - 68% of churned customers cite "inadequate diagnostic capabilities" as primary reason

   Calculation:
   ```
   Churn Cost = (Total Customers × Churn Rate × ARPU) × Diagnostic Contribution
              = (4,200 × 0.12 × $2,857) × 0.35
              = $1,440,000 × 0.35
              = $504,000 monthly churn cost
              = $6.05M annual churn cost
   ```
