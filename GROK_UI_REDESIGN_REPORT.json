Users never choose where to go before understanding what matters\n3. UI communicates system state before configuration\n4. Every page answers exactly one dominant question\n5. No pages whose sole purpose is CRUD\n6. Navigation reflects decisions and outcomes, not data models\n7. Screens must change understanding or enable action\n\nDesign Philosophy:\n- State Before Structure: Show what's happening before how it's organized\n- One Mental Model: Command center, not tool collection\n- Compression Over Expansion: tabs > pages, panels > navigation\n- Evidence, Not Assertions: Show WHY, not just status\n- Design for Escalation: Normal/Degradation/Failure/Action Required\n- UI Must Never Lie: Explicit failures, no silent degradation\n\nRequired Sections:\n🟦 DASHBOARD: \"Is Fleet working, and what matters right now?\"\n🟩 OPERATIONS: \"What actions can I take right now?\"\n🟨 ANALYTICS: \"What changed, when, and why should I care?\"\n🟥 ADMIN: \"How do I change the system without breaking it?\"\n🟪 INTEGRATIONS: \"Why is something not working?\"\n",
