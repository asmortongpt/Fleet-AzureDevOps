Below is the complete XML configuration for your `Info.plist` file tailored for an iOS application that requires background push-to-talk (PTT) functionality. This configuration includes the necessary permissions and capabilities for background audio, CallKit integration, and handling remote notifications and state synchronization.

```xml

<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">

    <string>This application requires microphone access to enable voice communication.</string>
    <key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
    <string>This application requires Bluetooth access to connect to external audio devices.</string>
    <key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
    <string>This application requires Bluetooth access to use with wireless audio peripherals.</string>

        <string>audio</string>
    </array>

    <!-- CallKit Configuration -->
    <!-- Ensure that the deployment target in your project settings is set to iOS 13.0 or higher -->
    <!-- CallKit framework should be linked in the project settings under "Link Binary with Libraries" -->

    <!-- Capabilities -->
    <!-- Ensure that the following capabilities are enabled in the Xcode project settings:
         - Push Notifications
         - Background Modes (with settings for Audio, AirPlay, and Picture in Picture)
         - Background fetch
         - Voice over IP
         - Remote notifications
    -->

</dict>
</plist>
```

### Additional Notes:
1. **CallKit Framework**: Make sure to import and link the CallKit framework in your Xcode project. This is not something you set in the `Info.plist` but rather in the project settings under "Link Binary with Libraries".

2. **iOS Deployment Target**: Ensure that the iOS deployment target for your project is set to iOS 13.0 or higher, as specified for CallKit requirements. This setting is adjusted in the Xcode project's general settings.

3. **Capabilities**: The capabilities such as Push Notifications, Background Modes, etc., need to be enabled in the Xcode project settings under the "Signing & Capabilities" tab. You can add these capabilities by clicking on the "+" icon and selecting the appropriate capability.

This configuration should be ready to paste directly into your `Info.plist` file and adjusted as necessary based on any additional specific requirements or changes in your project setup.
