Creating a comprehensive Azure DevOps pipeline for a project that includes an iOS app and a backend service, with deployment to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using blue-green and canary strategies, requires several steps. Below, I'll outline a YAML pipeline configuration that addresses your requirements. This example assumes you have basic familiarity with Azure DevOps and necessary permissions to create and manage pipelines, service connections, and variable groups.

### Prerequisites

1. **Azure DevOps Organization and Project**: Set up an Azure DevOps organization and a project.
2. **Service Connections**:
   - **Azure Service Connection**: For AKS deployments.
   - **Apple Developer Connection**: For iOS builds.
3. **Variable Groups**:
   - **iOSVariables**: Contains Apple Developer credentials and certificate information.
   - **BackendVariables**: Contains environment-specific configurations.
   - **DeploymentVariables**: Contains AKS configurations and deployment settings.

### Pipeline Structure

```yaml
trigger:
- main

resources:
- repo: self

variables:
- group: iOSVariables
- group: BackendVariables
- group: DeploymentVariables

stages:
- stage: Build
  jobs:
  - job: BuildiOS
    pool:
      vmImage: 'macOS-latest'
    steps:
    - checkout: self
    - task: InstallAppleCertificate@2
      inputs:
        certSecureFile: $(appleCertSecureFile)
        certPwd: $(appleCertPassword)
    - task: InstallAppleProvisioningProfile@1
      inputs:
        provisioningProfileLocation: 'secureFiles'
        provProfileSecureFile: $(appleProvProfileSecureFile)
    - script: |
        xcodebuild -project MyProject.xcodeproj -scheme MyScheme -sdk iphoneos -configuration Release build CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="$(APPLE_DEVELOPER_IDENTITY)" PROVISIONING_PROFILE="$(APPLE_PROV_PROFILE_UUID)"
      displayName: 'Build iOS App'
    - task: CopyFiles@2
      inputs:
        SourceFolder: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/build'
        Contents: '**'
        TargetFolder: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/iOSApp'
    - task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
      inputs:
        PathtoPublish: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/iOSApp'
        ArtifactName: 'iOSApp'
        publishLocation: 'container'

  - job: BuildBackend
    pool:
      vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
    steps:
    - checkout: self
    - script: |
        docker build -t mybackend:$(Build.BuildId) .
      displayName: 'Build Docker Image'
    - script: |
        docker push mybackend:$(Build.BuildId)
      displayName: 'Push Docker Image to Registry'
    - task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
      inputs:
        PathtoPublish: 'manifests'
        ArtifactName: 'manifests'
        publishLocation: 'container'

- stage: Test
  jobs:
  - job: RunTests
    pool:
      vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
    steps:
    - checkout: self
    - script: |
        echo "Run automated tests here"
      displayName: 'Run Tests'

- stage: Deploy
  dependsOn: Test
  condition: succeeded()
  jobs:
  - deployment: DeployToAKS
    environment: 'production'
    strategy:
      runOnce:
        deploy:
          steps:
          - download: current
            artifact: manifests
          - task: KubernetesManifest@0
            inputs:
              action: 'deploy'
              kubernetesServiceConnection: 'AKSServiceConnection'
              manifests: '$(Pipeline.Workspace)/manifests/*.yaml'
              containers: |
                mybackend:$(Build.BuildId)
          - task: ManualValidation@0
            timeoutInMinutes: 1440 # Timeout for manual approval
          - task: AzureAppServiceManage@0
            inputs:
              Action: 'Swap Slots'
              azureSubscription: 'AzureServiceConnection'
              WebAppName: 'myappservice'
              ResourceGroupName: 'myresourcegroup'
              SourceSlot: 'staging'
              TargetSlot: 'production'

- stage: Monitor
  jobs:
  - job: MonitorDeployment
    pool:
      vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
    steps:
    - script: |
        echo "Monitor deployment and perform automated rollback if necessary"
      displayName: 'Monitor and Rollback'
```

### Explanation

1. **Build Stage**: Compiles the iOS app and backend Docker image.
2. **Test Stage**: Runs automated tests.
3. **Deploy Stage**: Deploys to AKS with manual approval and slot swapping for blue-green deployment.
4. **Monitor Stage**: Monitors the deployment and performs rollback if needed.

### Notes

- Ensure all secrets and credentials are stored securely in Azure DevOps or Azure Key Vault.
- Modify the `vmImage`, Docker commands, and Kubernetes manifests as per your specific project requirements.
- The iOS build steps require a macOS agent.
- The deployment strategy should be adjusted based on the specifics of your blue-green and canary requirements.

This pipeline is a starting point and should be customized to fit the specific needs and compliance requirements of your project.
