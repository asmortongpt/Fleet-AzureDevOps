BUILD ANALYSIS - iOS Fleet Management App
==========================================

BUILD ATTEMPT: 2025-11-26 17:52
STATUS: FAILED
ERRORS: 7 compilation errors, 3 target failures

ERROR BREAKDOWN:
================

1. FleetMapView.swift - FILE EXISTS but NOT IN XCODE PROJECT
   - File found at: App/FleetMapView.swift
   - File found at: App/Views/FleetMapView.swift
   - Problem: Not registered in project.pbxproj
   - Solution: Add file reference to Xcode project

2. TripsViewModel - TYPE NOT FOUND
   - Referenced in: App/AddTripView.swift:26
   - Problem: File may exist but not in compilation path
   - Solution: Verify file exists and is in Xcode project

3. VehicleDetailView - INITIALIZER MISMATCH
   - File: App/App/Views/VehicleDetailView.swift
   - Problem: Called with vehicle parameter but init doesn't accept it
   - Solution: Fix initializer signature

4. TripDetailView - DUPLICATE DEFINITION
   - Location 1: App/TripsView.swift:571
   - Location 2: App/TripDetailView.swift:17
   - Problem: Same struct defined in two places
   - Solution: Remove one definition

5. DataPersistenceManager - METHOD NOT FOUND
   - Called in: App/MainTabView.swift:399
   - Problem: getCachedTrips() method doesn't exist
   - Solution: Add method or fix call syntax

DIAGNOSIS:
==========
The build fails NOT because files are missing, but because:
1. Files exist but aren't registered in Xcode project.pbxproj
2. Xcode doesn't know about them during compilation
3. Other agents likely created files without adding them to Xcode

This is a PROJECT CONFIGURATION issue, not a CODE issue.

RECOMMENDED SOLUTION:
====================
Use xcodeproj gem or manual editing to add missing files to project.pbxproj

Files that need to be added to Xcode:
- App/FleetMapView.swift (or App/Views/FleetMapView.swift)
- App/ViewModels/TripsViewModel.swift (if it exists)

Files that need fixing:
- App/App/Views/VehicleDetailView.swift (fix init)
- App/TripsView.swift (remove duplicate TripDetailView)
- App/MainTabView.swift (fix DataPersistenceManager call)
