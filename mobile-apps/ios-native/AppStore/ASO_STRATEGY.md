**Optimization:**
- ✅ Test with/without text
- ✅ Test different color schemes

### Test Hypothesis Template

**For each test, document:**

**Test Name:** [Descriptive name]

**Hypothesis:** We believe that [change] will result in [outcome] because [reasoning].

**Metric:** [Primary metric to measure]

**Variants:**
- Control: [Current version]
- Variant A: [First alternative]
- Variant B: [Second alternative]

**Sample Size:** [Minimum impressions needed]

**Duration:** [How long to run test]

**Success Criteria:** [What improvement constitutes success]

**Decision:** [Go with variant if...] OR [Keep control if...]

---

### Example Test: Screenshot Order

**Test Name:** Screenshot Order Optimization

**Hypothesis:** We believe that leading with our security/compliance differentiator (instead of dashboard) will increase conversion rate because our target government audience prioritizes security over UI.

**Metric:** Product Page View → Download conversion rate

**Variants:**
- Control: Dashboard → OBD2 → GPS → Inspection → Security
- Variant A: Security → GPS → OBD2 → Dashboard → Inspection
- Variant B: GPS → Security → OBD2 → Inspection → Dashboard

**Sample Size:** 10,000 product page views per variant (30,000 total)

**Duration:** 3 weeks (or until sample size reached)

**Success Criteria:**
- >5% relative CVR improvement = Winner
- 2-5% improvement = Consider (maybe)
- <2% improvement = No change

**Decision:**
- If Variant A or B wins by >5%, implement immediately
- If no clear winner, keep control
- Document learnings for future tests
