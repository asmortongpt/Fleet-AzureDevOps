### IS-4: Battery Drain Complaints

**Template:**
```
Hi [Username],

Thank you for the feedback about battery usage. We optimize for efficiency and want to help reduce battery drain.

DCF Fleet Management uses location services which naturally consume battery, especially during active trip tracking. Expected usage is <10% per hour during active tracking.

To optimize battery life:
1. End trips when not actively tracking
2. Enable Background App Refresh only if needed
3. Use "While Using App" location permission instead of "Always"
4. Close app when not in use

If you're experiencing >15% battery drain per hour, there may be an issue. Please email support@capitaltechalliance.com with:
- iPhone model
- iOS version
- When battery drain occurs (active trip, background, etc.)

We'll investigate further.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

## FAQ for Support Team

**Q: Should we ask users to change their rating?**
A: No. Apple's guidelines prohibit this, and it's generally poor practice. Focus on solving their problem, and they may update on their own.

**Q: Can we respond to reviews more than once?**
A: Yes, but use sparingly. You can respond once more if user provides new info or situation changes significantly.

**Q: Should we respond to every review?**
A: Ideally yes, but prioritize: 1-3 stars first, then 5 stars, then 4 stars.

**Q: How long should responses be?**
A: Negative reviews: More detailed. Positive reviews: Brief is fine. Generally 50-150 words.

**Q: Can we delete or edit our responses?**
A: You can edit within a short window after posting. After that, no editing. Choose words carefully.

**Q: What if the reviewer is wrong?**
A: Never say they're wrong. Clarify politely: "I understand the confusion. Here's how [feature] actually works..."

**Q: Should we respond to reviews in other languages?**
A: Yes, use translation tools but have native speaker verify if possible. Many review platforms support this.
