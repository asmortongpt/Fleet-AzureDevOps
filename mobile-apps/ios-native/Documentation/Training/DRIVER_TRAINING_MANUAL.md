## Trip Tracking Best Practices

### Maximizing Accuracy and Reliability

Trip tracking is the core function of the Fleet Management app. Following these best practices ensures accurate records, compliance, and better fleet insights.

### GPS Accuracy Tips

**Before Starting Trip:**

1. **Ensure clear GPS signal:**
   - Stand outside or near a window for 30 seconds
   - Wait for GPS indicator to show green (±5 meter accuracy)
   - Avoid starting trips inside garages or tunnels

2. **Optimize phone settings:**
   - Keep Location Services enabled
   - Set to "Always" for Fleet Management app
   - Disable Battery Saver mode during trips
   - Keep phone near window or on dash mount

3. **Check GPS accuracy indicator:**
   - Green: Excellent (±5m) - Proceed
   - Yellow: Fair (±20m) - Wait a moment
   - Red: Poor (±50m+) - Move to better location

**During Trip:**

- Keep phone in consistent location (not in glovebox or center console)
- Avoid frequent app switching (runs in background efficiently)
- Phone calls don't affect GPS tracking
- Music streaming apps are fine

**Troubleshooting GPS Issues:**

- **Weak signal in urban canyons:** GPS may be less accurate downtown - this is normal
- **Tunnel gaps:** GPS data pauses in tunnels automatically
- **Route deviation:** App auto-corrects if you deviate from expected route
- **Missing segments:** Contact support if you notice large gaps

### Battery Management for Long Shifts

**Expected Battery Usage:**
- Active tracking: ~10% battery per hour
- Background tracking: ~5% battery per hour
- With OBD2 connected: Additional 2-3% per hour

**Optimization Strategies:**

1. **Charge Before Shift:**
   - Start with 80-100% battery
   - Full charge lasts 8-10 hour shift with normal use

2. **In-Vehicle Charging:**
   - Use vehicle USB port or 12V adapter
   - Keep phone charging while driving
   - Recommended: Fast charging adapter (20W+)

3. **iOS Settings Optimization:**
   - Enable "Low Power Mode" if below 20%
   - Reduce screen brightness
   - Disable unnecessary background apps
   - Turn off automatic downloads

4. **App Battery Settings:**
   - Go to Profile > Settings > Battery Optimization
   - Enable "Eco Mode" for longer battery life
   - Adjust GPS update frequency: 5s (high accuracy) to 30s (battery saver)

**Emergency Low Battery Protocol:**

If battery drops below 10% during trip:

1. Trip data is safe (auto-saves every 30 seconds)
2. Enable Low Power Mode immediately
3. Close all other apps
4. Find charging source ASAP
5. If phone dies, trip will resume when powered back on
6. Contact fleet manager if unable to complete trip properly

### Handling Trip Interruptions

**Scenario: Scheduled Break or Lunch**

1. Tap **Pause Trip** (yellow button)
2. Trip timer stops but trip remains active
3. GPS tracking pauses to save battery
4. When ready to continue, tap **Resume Trip**
5. Trip continues from exact same point

**Scenario: Unexpected Stop (Traffic, Breakdown, etc.)**

1. Keep trip active - no action needed
2. App detects when vehicle is stopped
3. Idle time is tracked separately from drive time
4. Add waypoint with note if needed

**Scenario: Extended Delay (1+ hours)**

1. Consider pausing trip to save battery
2. Add note explaining delay reason
3. Resume when ready to continue
4. Fleet manager can review extended idle periods

**Scenario: Multiple Destinations**

1. Keep single trip running for entire route
2. Add waypoint at each stop:
   - Tap **Add Waypoint** button
   - Enter location name (e.g., "Customer #1 - ABC Corp")
   - Add note (e.g., "Delivered 3 pallets")
   - Take photo proof if required
3. End trip only when returning to base/home

**Scenario: App Crashes or Phone Restarts**

1. Don't panic - trip data is safe
2. Reopen app immediately
3. App will detect interrupted trip
4. Tap **Resume Trip** when prompted
5. GPS tracking continues from last saved point
6. Small gap may occur (typically <1 minute)

### Avoiding Common Mistakes

**Mistake #1: Forgetting to End Trip**

**Problem:** Trip continues recording overnight or after shift

**Solution:**
- Set reminder for end of shift
- App sends notification if trip exceeds 12 hours
- Fleet manager can end trip remotely if needed

**How to Fix:**
- Contact fleet manager immediately
- They can adjust end time to match actual completion
- Don't worry - won't affect your record if honest mistake

**Mistake #2: Wrong Vehicle Selected**

**Problem:** Trip recorded to incorrect vehicle

**Solution:**
- Double-check vehicle selection screen before starting
- Verify license plate and vehicle number match
- App shows vehicle photo for confirmation

**How to Fix:**
- Tap **Report Data Issue** from trip summary
- Select "Wrong Vehicle"
- Specify correct vehicle
- Fleet manager will reassign trip

**Mistake #3: Personal Trip Recorded**

**Problem:** Accidentally left trip running for personal errand
