   - Use colors to highlight exceptions
   - Minimize non-essential widgets

2. **Use Tags Liberally:**
   - Tag vehicles by location, department, special use
   - Filter and report by tags easily
   - Much more flexible than rigid hierarchies

3. **Create Report Templates:**
   - Set up common reports with standard formatting
   - Save time on recurring reports
   - Ensure consistency

4. **Use Comments and Notes:**
   - Add context to data (why was vehicle out of service, explanation for unusual cost)
   - Helps future you and your team understand history

5. **Set Realistic Alerts:**
   - Too many alerts = alert fatigue = ignored alerts
   - Start with critical only, add others as needed
   - Review and adjust alert thresholds quarterly

6. **Regular Data Cleanup:**
   - Monthly: Review and close resolved issues
   - Quarterly: Archive old vehicles and drivers
   - Annually: Review and update vehicle values, budgets, standards

7. **Leverage Mobile App:**
   - Install on your phone
   - Stay connected even when out of office
   - Respond to critical issues immediately
   - Review daily metrics during commute

8. **Learn Excel/Data Analysis:**
   - Export data for deeper analysis
   - Pivot tables are your friend
   - Build custom analyses not available in system

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

1. **Ignoring Data Quality:**
   - Garbage in = garbage out
   - Train drivers to enter accurate data
   - Review and audit regularly
   - Correct errors promptly

2. **Analysis Paralysis:**
   - Don't get lost in endless data
   - Focus on actionable insights
   - 80/20 rule: Focus on metrics that drive most value

3. **Set-It-and-Forget-It:**
   - Don't just set up system and ignore
   - Regular reviews and adjustments needed
   - Technology is tool, you're still the manager

4. **Micromanaging with Data:**
   - Data should inform, not control
   - Use for coaching and improvement, not gotcha moments
   - Trust but verify

5. **Neglecting User Training:**
   - System only works if users use it properly
   - Invest in training (initial and ongoing)
   - Make sure everyone understands why data matters
