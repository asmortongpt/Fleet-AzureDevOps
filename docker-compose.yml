This docker-compose file creates three services: api, postgres, and redis. Each service is configured with a health check, restart policy, and resource limits. The api service is built from a Dockerfile located in the ./api directory. The postgres and redis services use the postgres:15-alpine and redis:7-alpine images, respectively. Persistent volumes are used for data storage for the postgres and redis services. All services are part of the fleet-network network.
