## COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY

### The Big Picture
The fleet management market is rapidly consolidating around 5 major players, each controlling a specific market segment. Our opportunity is in the **underserved mid-market (50-250 vehicles)** where:

1. **Growth is fastest** (15-20% CAGR vs 5-10% enterprise)
2. **Pain points are clearest** (cost, support, flexibility)
3. **Customers are most flexible** (not yet locked into ecosystem)
4. **Competition is most fragmented** (no clear leader at this size)
5. **Win rates are achievable** (40-50% possible)

### The Strategic Insight
Rather than compete head-to-head with Samsara for enterprise or Motive for SMB, we own the middle: customers who have grown beyond SMB but aren't yet large enough to need Samsara's enterprise complexity. We're the "Goldilocks platform" - just right for mid-market growth.

### The Execution Reality
Success requires:
1. **Clear positioning** (mid-market focus, not trying to be everything)
2. **Competitive pricing** (20-30% cheaper than Samsara)
3. **Superior support** (24-hour response, resolved in days)
4. **Modern platform** (Geotab-level open APIs, but 2025 UX)
5. **Flexible contracts** (month-to-month options, no forced 3-year lock-in)
