# Allow DNS Resolution Network Policy
# Allows all pods to resolve DNS through kube-dns/CoreDNS
#
# SECURITY NOTE: DNS resolution is required for all pods to function
# This policy allows both UDP and TCP on port 53 to the kube-dns service
# Without this policy, pods cannot resolve service names or external domains
