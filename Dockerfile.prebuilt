# Simplified Dockerfile that uses a pre-built dist folder
# This avoids the memory issues with ACR's build environment

FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the pre-built dist folder
COPY dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy nginx server configuration (without global directives)
COPY nginx-server.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Start nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
