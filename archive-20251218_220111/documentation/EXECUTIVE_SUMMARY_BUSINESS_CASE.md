## CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT

Fleet Management Software represents one of the fastest-growing segments in enterprise software ($28.2B market in 2025, growing at 17% CAGR through 2029). The global fleet management market is consolidating around four major players: **Samsara, Geotab, Verizon Connect, and Motive**, with smaller regional players capturing niche segments.

Our Fleet platform currently scores **6.5/10 in competitive positioning**, with strength in architecture and technology foundation but significant gaps in market-ready features, customer acquisition infrastructure, and competitive differentiation. We have built a comprehensive product (120+ components, 50+ modules) but lack the market focus, enterprise readiness, and go-to-market strategy required to compete effectively against established players.

**Current Revenue:** $0 (pre-revenue)
**Current Customer Base:** 0
**Product Completeness:** 65% (core features present, polish and integrations needed)
**Market Awareness:** <1% in target segments
