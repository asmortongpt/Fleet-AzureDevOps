## POTENTIAL OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES

### "We're already invested in Samsara"
**Response**: "And Samsara is a good product - that's why we built something better. We can run parallel for 90 days so you can compare side-by-side. If we don't outperform, no commitment."

### "You're a startup, Samsara is established"
**Response**: "True - and that's your advantage. Samsara treats you like account #47,329. We treat you like our flagship customer. Every feature we build considers Tallahassee's needs first."

### "What about hardware?"
**Response**: "We integrate with your existing OBD2 devices, or we provide new ones - your choice. No rip-and-replace required."

### "Implementation sounds risky"
**Response**: "6-month phased rollout, 500 vehicles per month. Start with one department, prove value, then expand. You're in control the entire time."

### "Why should we trust you?"
**Response**: "Look at what we built - this is production-grade infrastructure running on Azure, FedRAMP compliant, enterprise security. We're not a garage startup. And at $20/vehicle, you're saving $15-20 per vehicle vs. Samsara - that's $45K-60K per month in your budget."
