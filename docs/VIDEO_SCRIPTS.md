*[Set constraints]*

"Set vehicle constraints. If you're using a cargo van, set the capacity. If there are size or weight restrictions, add those. The system will ensure the route is feasible."

*[Set preferences]*

"Choose preferences. Prioritize fastest time, shortest distance, or lowest fuel cost. Avoid highways or tolls if needed."

*[Optimize]*

"Click 'Optimize Route.' The system calculates thousands of possible sequences and selects the best one."

**[02:00-02:40] Reviewing the Optimized Route**
*[Show optimized route]*

"Here's your optimized route! The stops are reordered for maximum efficiency. See the before and after comparison: original route was 87 miles and 3.2 hours. Optimized route is 62 miles and 2.4 hours. That's 25 miles and 48 minutes saved!"
