## ⚡ KEY TALKING POINTS

### Opening:
*"Tallahassee operates the #1 fleet in America. You deserve technology as advanced as your operation. We can save you $200,000-400,000 per year while giving you capabilities Samsara doesn't have."*

### When They Ask About Cost:
*"Our price is $20/vehicle/month - that's 20-40% cheaper than Samsara. For your 3,000-vehicle fleet, that's $180,000-480,000 back in your budget every year."*

### When They Ask "Why You?":
*"Samsara is account #47,329 to them. You're our flagship customer. Every feature we build considers Tallahassee first. Plus, we have 104 AI agents, 3D damage visualization, and government-specific compliance that Samsara doesn't offer."*

### If They're Hesitant:
*"Let's start with a 500-vehicle pilot in your Police or Public Works department. $250,000 implementation, 90-day evaluation. If we don't outperform Samsara, no long-term commitment. You'll see the value firsthand."*

## ❌ OBJECTION HANDLING

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We're invested in Samsara" | "Run us parallel for 90 days. Compare side-by-side. No commitment until you see we're better." |
| "You're a startup" | "True - and that's your advantage. We treat you like our flagship, not account #47,329. Plus, we're enterprise-grade: Azure, FedRAMP, production security." |
| "Implementation risky" | "6-month phased rollout, 500 vehicles/month. Start small, prove value, expand. You control the pace." |
| "What about hardware?" | "We integrate with your existing OBD2 devices. No rip-and-replace." |
| "Budget constraints" | "We SAVE you $180K-480K/year. Even with implementation, you're cash-positive by Year 2." |
