### The Solution

Our Fleet Management System reduces operational costs by **15-25%** through:

- Automated maintenance scheduling
- Real-time vehicle tracking
- Fuel efficiency monitoring
- Compliance management
- Predictive analytics

### The ROI

**For a 50-vehicle fleet:**

| Category | Annual Cost (Before) | Annual Cost (After) | Savings |

## The Problem

### Pain Points Fleet Managers Face Daily

#### 1. Reactive Maintenance Culture

**Current State:**
- Vehicles break down unexpectedly
- Emergency repairs cost 3x preventive maintenance
- Downtime impacts revenue
- No visibility into upcoming needs

**Impact:**
- $35,000-$50,000 annual unplanned costs (50-vehicle fleet)
- 2-5 days downtime per breakdown
- Lost productivity and customer satisfaction

---

#### 2. Compliance Nightmares

**Current State:**
- Manual tracking of:
  - DOT inspections
  - Driver licenses and CDLs
  - Medical cards
  - Vehicle registrations
  - Insurance certificates
- Paper-based logs and files
- Missing expiration dates
- Failed audits

**Impact:**
- $5,000-$150,000 DOT fines per violation
- Insurance claims denied
- Vehicles grounded
- Reputation damage

---

#### 3. Fuel Cost Opacity

**Current State:**
- No visibility into:
  - Fuel efficiency by vehicle
  - Driver behavior impact
  - Unauthorized purchases
  - Optimal refueling locations
- End-of-month surprises
- Budget overruns

**Impact:**
- 10-15% fuel waste
- $20,000-$30,000 annual overspend (50 vehicles)
- No accountability

---

#### 4. Administrative Burden

**Current State:**
- 15-20 hours/week on:
  - Spreadsheet updates
  - Phone tag with drivers
  - Manual report creation

- No single source of truth

**Impact:**
- $78,000 annual labor cost (at $75/hr)
- Errors and omissions
- Delayed decision-making
- Burnout

---

#### 5. Zero Visibility

**Current State:**
- "Where's my vehicle?" = 20 phone calls
- "When will it be ready?" = guesswork
- No real-time status
- No predictive analytics
- Reactive decisions only

**Impact:**
- Poor customer service
- Inefficient routing

## ROI Calculator

### Use Your Numbers

Enter your fleet details to calculate expected ROI:

---

### Fleet Size & Costs

| Input | Your Fleet | Demo Example |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Number of vehicles | ______ | 50 |
| Annual miles per vehicle | ______ | 25,000 |
| Average fuel cost per gallon | $______ | $3.85 |
| Average MPG | ______ | 18 |
| Annual maintenance per vehicle | $______ | $2,500 |
| Fleet manager hourly rate | $______ | $75 |
| Administrative hours per week | ______ | 20 |

---

### Savings Calculation

#### 1. Maintenance Savings

**Current Annual Cost:**
```
Number of vehicles × Annual maintenance per vehicle
50 × $2,500 = $125,000
```

**Projected Savings:** 25% (industry average)
```
$125,000 × 0.25 = $31,250
```

**How:**
- Preventive maintenance reduces reactive repairs
- Automated scheduling eliminates missed services
- Better parts pricing through vendor management
- Extended vehicle life

---

#### 2. Fuel Savings

**Current Annual Cost:**
```
(Number of vehicles × Annual miles ÷ MPG) × Cost per gallon
(50 × 25,000 ÷ 18) × $3.85 = $218,400
```

**Projected Savings:** 10% (conservative estimate)
```
$218,400 × 0.10 = $21,840
```

**How:**
- Identify inefficient vehicles
- Coach inefficient drivers
- Route optimization
- Reduce idle time
- Prevent unauthorized use

---

#### 3. Administrative Savings

**Current Annual Cost:**
```
Hours per week × Hourly rate × 52 weeks
20 × $75 × 52 = $78,000
```

**Projected Savings:** 40% time reduction
```
$78,000 × 0.40 = $31,200
```

**How:**
- Automated reporting
- Digital work orders
- Self-service driver portal
- Integrated systems
- Mobile access

---

#### 4. Downtime Reduction

**Current Annual Cost:**
```
Avg. breakdowns per year × Avg. cost per breakdown
50 vehicles × 1.5 breakdowns × $600/day × 2 days = $45,000
```

**Projected Savings:** 60% reduction
```
$45,000 × 0.60 = $27,000
```

**How:**
- Preventive maintenance
- Early problem detection
- Faster repairs (digital work orders)
- Better parts availability

---

### Total ROI Calculation

**Total Annual Savings:**
```
Maintenance:     $31,250
Fuel:            $21,840
Administrative:  $31,200
Downtime:        $27,000
─────────────────────────
TOTAL:          $111,290
```

**Annual Investment:**
- Software license: $19,000 (see pricing below)
- Implementation: $5,000 (one-time)

**First Year ROI:**
```
(Savings - Investment) ÷ Investment × 100
($111,290 - $19,000) ÷ $19,000 × 100 = 486%
```

**Ongoing ROI (Year 2+):**
```
$111,290 ÷ $19,000 × 100 = 586%
```

**Payback Period:**
```
Investment ÷ Monthly savings
$24,000 ÷ $9,274 = 2.6 months
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General

**Q: How is this different from a spreadsheet?**

A: Spreadsheets require manual updates, don't send alerts, can't automate workflows, and don't scale. Our system automates 80% of the work, prevents costly oversights, and scales from 10 to 10,000 vehicles.

---

**Q: What if we already have GPS/telematics?**

A: We integrate with 50+ telematics providers (Verizon, Samsara, Geotab, etc.). You keep your existing hardware and get enhanced fleet management features.

---

**Q: Can we try before we buy?**

A: Absolutely. We offer 30-day free pilots with up to 20 vehicles. Full access, full support, no credit card required.

---

### Implementation

**Q: How long does it really take?**

A: Standard implementation is 2-4 weeks. Record is 3 days (small fleet, clean data). We'll give you a custom timeline based on your specific situation.

---

**Q: Do we need IT resources?**

A: No. We're cloud-hosted (SaaS). No servers, no installation, no IT required. Just a web browser.

---

**Q: What data do you need from us?**

A: Vehicle list (VINs, make/model), driver licenses, current maintenance schedules (if any). We can work with Excel, CSV, or manual entry.

---

### Pricing

**Q: Are there hidden fees?**

A: No. Our pricing is transparent: monthly license + one-time setup. Add-ons (like hardware) are clearly listed. No surprises.

---

**Q: Can we start small and scale up?**

A: Yes! Many clients start with 10-20 vehicles to prove ROI, then expand. You can add vehicles anytime - prorated pricing.

---

**Q: What happens if we need to downsize?**

A: Annual contracts. You can reduce vehicle count at renewal. We also offer monthly contracts (20% premium).

---

### Support

**Q: What kind of support do you provide?**

A:
- Starter: Email support (24-hour response)
- Professional: Priority support (4-hour response)
- Enterprise: Dedicated account manager + phone support

---

**Q: What if we need custom features?**

A: We offer custom development at $150/hour. Most requests are 10-40 hours. We'll scope it out and give you a fixed quote.

---

**Q: Do you provide training?**

A: Yes, comprehensive training is included in all implementations. Additional training available at $1,500/day.

---

### Security & Compliance

**Q: How secure is our data?**

A:
- SOC 2 Type II certified
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Daily backups (7-year retention)
- Role-based access control
