# Unified Fleet Intelligence for Tallahassee

**One Platform. Complete Control. Seamless Integration.**

*Consolidate your fleet operations while keeping your existing Samsara investment*

![Fleet Logo](../../public/logos/logo-horizontal.svg)

---

## Executive Summary

The City of Tallahassee currently operates with a fragmented fleet management approach:
- **Samsara devices** for telematics on some vehicles
- **Separate fuel management application** for fuel tracking
- **Multiple systems** requiring manual data reconciliation

**Our Solution:** A unified Fleet Management Platform that:
- **Integrates directly with your existing Samsara devices** - no hardware changes needed
- **Consolidates fuel management** into a single platform
- **Provides complete fleet visibility** across all city departments
- **Ensures government compliance** with DOT, IFTA, OSHA, and municipal requirements

---

## The Problem with Fragmented Systems

| Challenge | Impact on Tallahassee |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Multiple logins & interfaces | Staff inefficiency, training overhead |
| Data silos between systems | Incomplete reporting, blind spots |
| Manual data reconciliation | Wasted staff hours, error-prone |
| Separate fuel tracking | Missed optimization opportunities |
| No unified compliance view | Audit preparation burden |
| Inconsistent driver visibility | Safety gaps across fleet segments |

**Result:** Higher operational costs, increased administrative burden, and reduced fleet efficiency.
